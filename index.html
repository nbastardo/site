    <p>Welcome. Analog audio signal is converted into digital audio signal through the use of an analog-to-digital converter. 
      The waveform of the analog signal is monitored and is recreated digitally by taking periodic samples every small moment of time. The rate at which the samples are taken is called the sample rate. 
      The higher the sample rate, the more frequently the frequency/amplitude is captured by the computer and graphed. To add more detail to the graph, the bit depth can be increased. 
      This essentially adds more possible 'coordinates' to the graph, making it smoother and closer to the waveform of the original analog signal. This can be compared to increasing the resolution of a photograph: increasing the bit depth is comparable to increasing the number of pixels in a photo.</p>
